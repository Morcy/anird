<recommendations total="3">
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="265677">Intriguing deconstruction of e.g. Pinochio/idol-singer and mini mecha themes. Early episodes are mind numbing as the plot build-up is unusually long, but eventually satisfying.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="298777">heart wrenching anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="108652">Very good series. I saw this for thr first time about ten years ago and it is still one of my favorites. Don`t let the one and only review keep you from watching it. In my book it is probably worth an 8 or maybe even a 9.</recommendation>

<description>Classmates at school simply call http://anidb.net/ch16608 [Mima Tokiko] Key... as in the `key` to a strange mystery. The waif-like android-girl without emotions was left behind when her kindly old scientist `grandfather`, http://anidb.net/ch16609 [Mima Murao], passed away, without a way to learn how to smile. But a message for Key suggests a fantastic possibility... Could there be a way for her to become a real human, by winning the love of 30,000 friends?</description>

<name>Music</name>
<description>Music anime generally revolves around people concerned with music in their everyday lives. In addition they often adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for competitions, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal.

<name>Future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.&#13;
&#13;
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). To its inhabitants, our planet is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. The Earth is the main setting of most fiction, but many titles are set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, and in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by invaders.</description>

<name>realistic sci-fi setting</name>
<count>14</count>
<description>This anime really takes science seriously. Such works try to maintain scientific accuracy and/or ephasize on that and are often called "hard sci-fi".
Viewer is to be convinced that depicted setting may be possible in theory via new techlology, political and social changes and so on.
Some examples of non-realistic elements are faster-than-light travel and noisy exlosions in space. Eventually it demands knowledge of what`s real to tell real from impossible, right?</description>

<description>What anime is complete without some group working in the shadows?
The organisation may be run by a government, large company or small group depending on their aims.
Espionage, political power, world domination, scientific research... so long as the general population is oblivious to their existence they will keep striving for their usually sinister goals.</description>

<name>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</name>
<count>74</count>
<description>The title of Philip K. Dick`s SF novel (movie: Blade Runner). 
The phrase implies a set of existential questions: Do artificial beings (e.g. Replicants, Bioroids, or other AI constructs) dream, feel, or have a soul? If memories can be implanted, what makes real memories real? By contrast — what makes humans human? What is reality? 
These are central themes e.g. in all of the Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed series / movies.</description>

<description>Social commentary is the act of rebelling against an individual, or a group of people by rhetorical means. This is most often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people’s sense of justice. (Source: Wikipedia)
Since this is anime, usually, the mores of Japan and the Japanese society are scrutinised.</description>

<description>Scenes of this show point to insanely strange events which seem to be taking place; throughout its episodes, the show may or may not explain what is going on. Either way, many viewers will find that a succint and accurate way to describe the show is "WTF?", and the show`s explanations (or lack thereof) to the events will often be subject of heated debate.</description>
